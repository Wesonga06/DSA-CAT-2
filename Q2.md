Question 2: Differentiate between arrays and linked lists in terms of: ο Memory allocation ο Performance ο Insertion and deletion operations (6 marks)

Memory Allocation in arrays contiguous memory blocks allocated at once while in Linked List memory is allocated dynamically(nodes stored in different locations)

Performance in array Faster acces time O(1) for indexed elements while in Linked List slower access time O(n)(traverse from the head)

Insertion and Deletion in arrays Costly O(n)(shifting elements required) while in Linked List efficient O(1) at head, O(n) at end/middle(just change pointers)
